## Data
This folder contains sample-wise evaluation metrics produced by the experiments in ["LaB-GATr: geometric algebra transformers for large biomedical surface and volume meshes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07536): wall shear stress (WSS) estimation, velocity estimation and postmenstrual age (PMA) estimation. We provide these metrics to enable statistical significance analysis compared to your results on the same datasets.
